# cub3D

## 🎮 Overview
**cub3D** is a 3D game project developed as part of the 42 curriculum, inspired by the classic **Wolfenstein 3D**. The project focuses on understanding and implementing **raycasting** algorithms to create a simple first-person shooter (FPS) engine. It simulates a 3D environment using 2D rendering techniques, allowing the player to navigate and interact within a maze-like world.

## ✨ Features
- **3D rendering using raycasting**
- **Player movement** with first-person controls
- **Grid-based map** with customizable layout
- **Texture mapping** for walls and objects
- **Collision detection** for walls and objects
- **Smooth frame rendering** for real-time gameplay

## 🔥 Bonus Features
In addition to the core functionalities, the project includes several **bonus features**:
- **Mouse control**: Added mouse movement for enhanced player control.
- **Sprite rendering**: Support for rendering 2D sprites within the 3D environment (e.g., enemies or items).
- **Minimap**: A functional minimap for real-time player navigation.
- **Multiple Levels**: Added support for multiple levels with varying difficulties.
- **Dynamic lighting**: Introduced lighting effects for a more immersive environment.
- **Shadowing**: Enhanced shadowing for immersive distance
